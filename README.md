# Get More Green 

A bidirectional gRPC made using channels, routines, and protobufs (and maybe even just a touch of love!) 

## What it Does

This RPC pushes out a stream of various shades of green. I'm making the argument that this RPC can bring you luck. That's certainly what I'm hoping for. Otherwise it's useless unless you _REALLY_ like green. 

## Getting Operational

**STEP 1**: Clone this repo. Cd in there. Run `go run server.go`

**STEP 2**: Open another terminal tab and run `go run client.go`

**STEP 3**: Receive and enjoy greens
